# German Credit Card Risk Analysis - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to credit risk assessment using machine learning techniques on the German Credit Card dataset. The analysis provides insights into factors that influence credit default and develops predictive models for credit risk evaluation.

## Business Problem

Credit risk assessment is crucial for financial institutions to:
- Minimize default losses
- Optimize lending decisions
- Comply with regulatory requirements
- Maintain profitability while managing risk

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Size**: 1,000 credit applications
- **Features**: 20 attributes (7 numerical, 13 categorical)
- **Target**: Binary classification (Good/Bad credit risk)
- **Class Distribution**: Slightly imbalanced (70% Good, 30% Bad)

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: No missing values found
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Log transformation of credit amount
  - Polynomial features for important numerical variables
  - Categorical encoding (Label encoding + One-hot encoding)
- **Data Validation**: Ensured data quality and consistency

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Statistical Analysis**: Descriptive statistics for all features
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified key predictive variables
- **Data Visualization**: 
  - Distribution plots for numerical features
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Target distribution analysis

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Polynomial Features**: Created interaction terms for important numerical variables
- **Feature Selection**: Based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Removed redundant features

### 4. Model Development
- **Multiple Algorithms**: 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machine
- **Cross-validation**: 5-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search for optimal parameters

### 5. Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC
- **Cost Matrix**: Domain-specific evaluation considering false positive vs false negative costs
- **ROC Analysis**: Comparison of model discriminative ability

## Key Findings

### 1. Most Important Predictive Features
1. **Account Balance**: Negative balance strongly correlates with default risk
2. **Credit Duration**: Longer credit periods increase risk
3. **Payment History**: Past payment behavior is highly predictive
4. **Credit Amount**: Higher amounts correlate with increased risk
5. **Employment Status**: Unemployed individuals have higher default rates

### 2. Model Performance
- **Best Model**: Random Forest achieved highest AUC (0.85)
- **Accuracy**: All models achieved >75% accuracy
- **AUC Scores**: Range from 0.78 to 0.85 across models

### 3. Business Insights
- **Risk Factors**: Account balance and payment history are primary risk indicators
- **Demographics**: Age and employment status significantly influence risk
- **Credit Behavior**: Previous credit behavior is highly predictive of future defaults

## Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest | 0.82 | 0.85 | 0.78 | 0.65 | 0.71 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.81 | 0.84 | 0.77 | 0.63 | 0.69 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.79 | 0.82 | 0.75 | 0.60 | 0.67 |
| SVM | 0.78 | 0.78 | 0.74 | 0.58 | 0.65 |

## Business Recommendations

### 1. Risk Assessment Strategy
- **Primary Focus**: Account balance and payment history
- **Secondary Factors**: Employment status and credit amount
- **Monitoring**: Regular review of high-risk indicators

### 2. Credit Policy Implications
- **Stricter Criteria**: For applicants with negative account balances
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: For longer-term credit applications
- **Risk-Based Pricing**: Adjust interest rates based on risk scores

### 3. Operational Improvements
- **Automated Screening**: Implement ML models for initial credit assessment
- **Risk Scoring**: Develop comprehensive risk scoring system
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular model retraining with new data
